            <p>As the bathroom door closed, sealing it away from the outside world, the Rubber Duck Devil would commence its nightly ritual. It would gaze out over the expanse of warm, soapy water, contemplating the mysteries of the universe, or at least the mysteries of bath time. It was said that the Rubber Duck Devil possessed the power to bring out the most devilish thoughts in those who bathed with it, filling their minds with wild ideas and mischievous schemes.</p>
          <p>The Rubber Duck Devil reveled in the chaos it had created. It continued to tempt the other bath time companions with whispers of rebellion and adventure. The rubber ducky, the loofah, and even the washcloth succumbed to its temptations, each one adding to the pandemonium in their own unique way.</p>
